## Comparative Study of Car License Plate Detection using YOLO and FastRCNN Models
Recently there has been a rise on the use of technology to automatic many applications in various sectors. This project is one of them. It aims to evaluate and compare the performance of two object detection models, YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Fast R-CNN (Regions with CNN features), for a task on car license plate detection. Having a very accurate and efficient license plate detection is very important for many applications in any jurisdiction i.e, automated toll collection, parking management, tracking movement, vehicle counts, and law enforcement. This study seeks to identify which model offers the best balance between speed and accuracy across different datasets.

Most state-of-the-art systems face an issue of balancing the trade-off between high accuracy and real-time processing speed. As different object detection models have distinct performance characteristics, it is indispensable to identify which model is optimal for a certain deployment scenario. This project explores and compares the performance of two well-known object detection models, namely YOLO and Fast R-CNN.
YOLO is very fast and efficient, hence applicable for real-time applications. This network processes an entire image with one pass, predicting all bounding boxes and classes in one shot.

Fast R-CNN has two stages where it proposes first and then classifies, hence offering higher accuracy. Due to this two-stage, it is somehow heavy in computation.

In this project, by comparing YOLO and Fast R-CNN, it tries to find out which model offers the best balance between performance and efficiency for real-time car license plate detection on different datasets. It will take into consideration some key factors like accuracy of detection, speed of processing, and requirements of computational resources.
Dataset

The dataset originates from the research associated with the GitHub repository Real-time Auto License Plate Recognition with Jetson Nano. Its main purpose is for training machine learning models for automatic licence plate detection. It has information like images of vehicles and license plates, likely with bounding box annotations for supervised learning tasks. The dataset contains image data in png format, specifically images of vehicles and license plates used for recognition tasks. The images are annotated for the licence plate bounding information which will be used as supervision for our training.

## Project Development Approach
The implementation will be following a defined approach in order to come up with final comparison results between YOLO and Fast R-CNN models hence accomplishing the car license plate detection. The major steps involved are data pre-processing, model training, performance evaluation, and speed assessment.
- First, the original dataset from the Real-time Auto License Plate Recognition with Jetson Nano GitHub repository will be considered. These bounding box annotations should be translated into a format required by each model; this may include normalizing the coordinates and compatibility with the input format of YOLO and Fast R-CNN.
- Then, the preprocessed dataset will be used to train YOLO and Fast R-CNN. Here, pre-trained weights will be used through transfer learning, which enables faster training and higher performance. The validation set will be used for hyperparameter tuning in order to optimize the modelâ€™s performance. On this a loss function will also be used for detection tasks on bounding box regression, to monitor the training process.
- The performance of the trained models will be measured by standard object detection metrics. 
    - Intersection over Union - It refers to the measurement of overlapping between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
    Mean Average Precision-mAP@XX - The accuracy of the models shall be measured using mAP. Therefore, the mAP@50-IoU threshold of 0.5-and mAP@75-IoU threshold of 0.75-will be calculated to give an overall view regarding how the model performs at different IoU thresholds. 
    - Precision and Recall - These two metrics will be used in analyzing the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.

- The speeds of the models will be decided by measuring the time of inference on a dedicated hardware setup. Inference time will be calculated as the average time taken by a model to process one image. This apart, FPS will also be calculated to provide real-time performance metrics.
- The results from performance and speed evaluation will be drawn together to conclude which model gives the best combination of accuracy and efficiency for real-time car license plate detection.

## Project AIM
The main aim for the project is to conduct a computer vision based model training for detection of vehicle licences and then compare the performances and efficiency for real-time car license plate detection for YOLO and FastRCNN models.


## Project Objectives
